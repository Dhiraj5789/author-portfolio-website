My sister-in-law wanted a website to start her own coaching/mentoring business, so I volunteered to make a portfolio website for her.

Firstly, we went through a lot of sample websites to decide the base theme of the project. We came across johngreenbooks.com, which looked so minimalistic and neat, and was well suited with her initial requirements.

I started inspecting the website and was going through the css used in the website, using devTools to catch sight of on hover css animations and transitions. I really didn't like the html structure of the website so I decided to have a my own proper semantic structure for the website. Something I learned from an HTML course. With the likes of aside, article, main, section, heading tags, paragrahs, etc.
